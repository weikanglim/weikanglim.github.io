I'm Wei Lim (full name: Wei Kang Lim -- aka `weiklim`), a software engineer based in Seattle. I have 8 years of professional software experience. I've been fortunate enough to work on interesting problems in many different areas throughout my career: full-stack business applications, DevOps infrastructure, engineering systems, back-end services, distributed systems, lightweight micro web services, CLI applications. 

I'm currently a senior software engineer that is part of the developer division at Microsoft. Improving developer productivity has always been a big interest of mine, and I'm glad that I get to work on improving developer tooling for Azure.

My current day-to-day programming language is `go`, with a hobbyist interest in`rust` development.

For those interested about background:

I graduated 2015 with a bachelor's degree in Physics and Computer Science, with a minor in Mathematics from North Dakota State University. I obtained my master's degree (online) in Computer Science from University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 2020. I grew up on the tropical Penang island of Malaysia.
